# Welcome to TangSDR

Welcome to **TangSDR** â€“ an open, low-cost **Software Defined Radio** project powered by FPGA.  
The idea is simple: build a **stand-alone SDR** that can cover roughly **0.1â€“200 MHz** with about **2â€“3 MHz bandwidth**, without breaking the bank.  
Target budget: **under â‚¬150** for the core hardware.

## Goals

- **Open & Hackable** â€“ all hardware, firmware and docs are free to study and modify.  
- **Stand-alone** â€“ with a display, audio codec and controls, no PC required.  
- **Affordable** â€“ parts chosen with the ham hackerâ€™s wallet in mind.  
- **Educational** â€“ a playground for learning FPGA design, RF frontends and SDR basics.  

## Whatâ€™s inside?

- **FPGA SoC:** Gowin Tang Nano 20K with LiteX + RISC-V  
- **Display:** 4â€³ TFT with touch support

This is a work in progress, made for and with the ham community.  
Feel free to follow along, share ideas, and join me on this journey.
